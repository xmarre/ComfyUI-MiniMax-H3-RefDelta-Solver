# MiniMax H3 RefDelta Solver v0.1.0

The initial experimental release provides a standalone rank-1024 RefDelta-aware custom sampling path for current ComfyUI.

## Solver

- ER-SDE-3 mathematics follows current ComfyUI and retains native MiniMax-H3 `ModelSamplingAV` semantics.
- Raw denoised anchors are differentiated using actual nonuniform ER solver coordinates.
- Bounded trajectory-risk signals smoothly gate stage 2, stage 3, and stochastic adaptation.
- Video and audio are reduced separately while remaining one packed H3 integration state.
- Optional bounded x0 trajectory correction is disabled by default.
- With all adaptations and telemetry disabled, the node delegates directly to native ComfyUI ER-SDE.

## Scheduler and diagnostics

- The scheduler weights a continuous beta(0.6, 0.6) prior with versioned rank-profile difficulty.
- The bundled rank-1024 profile is explicitly provisional and neutral pending matched same-state measurements.
- An optional dual-model guider compares fused and genuine Ref2VA x0/velocity on the same latent and conditioning.
- Scalar JSONL/CSV telemetry and offline profile/AdaLN-analysis tools are included.

## Compatibility

This release is standalone and deliberately does not claim Spectrum compatibility. Spectrum's native ER-SDE identity/digest and stochastic-ownership contract do not admit this adaptive sampler.

The implementation is experimental until representative rank-1024 GPU calibration and held-out media validation are completed.
